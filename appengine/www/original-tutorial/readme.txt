This directory contains sample code for using the OpenTok JavaScript API.

When testing these files from a local directory (not via a web server), 
if the web page asks you to set the Flash Player Settings, do the following:

1. Open this link in a new browser window: 

   http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html.

   The Flash Player Global Security Settings panel is displayed.

2. In the Alway trust files in these locations list click the Edit locations link and select Add location.

3. Click Browse for folder, navigate to the folder that contains the files you downloaded, and then click the Open button.

4. Click the Always Allow button.

   This grants the HTML pages in the folder you selected to communicate with Flash content served by tokbox.com. 
   (It also grants this communication from this folder to other servers, so be careful to select a specific folder.)

5. Reload the local version of the HTML file in your web browser.
